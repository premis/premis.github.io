>*"At the still point of the turning world. Neither flesh nor fleshless;*  
>*Neither from nor towards; at the still point, there the dance is,*  
>*But neither arrest nor movement. And do not call it fixity,*  
>*Where past and future are gathered. Neither movement from nor towards,*  
>*Neither ascent nor decline. Except for the point, the still point,*  
>*There would be no dance, and there is only the dance.*  
>*I can only say, there we have been: but I cannot say where.*  
>*And I cannot say, how long, for that is to place it in time."*  

— T.S. Eliot, Burnt Norton, Four Quartets, Harcourt, Brace and Company, 1943.
