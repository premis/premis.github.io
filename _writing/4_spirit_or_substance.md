For now, to attempt a definition for it, spiritual bypassing is the misuse of spiritual ideas, 
practices, or beliefs to avoid confronting uncomfortable emotions, psychological wounds, 
and unresolved developmental tasks. It acts as a defense mechanism and fosters a false 
sense of enlightenment or "toxic positivity" to escape painful human experiences. It's so 
popular I'm sure we've all experienced it. What's the downside? 

Oh well... I suggest drugs instead, at least all the "work" is avoided, and you 
have plenty to choose from: LSD, psilocybin, ketamine, and MDMA, cocaine (for the shy) and 
even weed does wonders. 
They are even cheap I hear and offer you so much more than working hard to get "spiritually 
bypassed" when all you need is a pill. It covers your wounds just fine. Makes you a guru. 
God even.

kālo means time and also it means death. It is usually an attribute of Lord Shiva, manifest as Kalabhairava, the Lord of Time or Death. But He is also manifest in the aspect of Kalantaka, the ender of time. But also the ender of death ( the ender of ending - he who conquers death and transcends time ). However above it is Lord Krishna in the form of Vishvarupa, who is professing that “I am Time, the maker of the destruction of worlds, fully arisen, engaged here in annihilating the worlds.” For those who do not know, all the deities in Hinduism ( at least according to serious schools of 
Hindu philosophy ) are ultimately One and the same single ultimate God or Reality or Existence. 
Or at least, the major ones ( not all the million gods in everyone's backyard).
