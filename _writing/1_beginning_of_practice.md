People often times can embark on a path under certain conditions only. There are 
those who must understand first (or at least to become convinced by theoretical solidity), 
there are those who must believe first (or become convinced by a more emotional way)
and there are those who require neither since they are just curious and enthusiastic by 
their own nature. 

For those who must understand, the entire Philosophy section is dedicated to just that. 

For those who must believe, this is not my place, I'm no guru, I'm no saint, cannot 
seduce people into a belief or another and wouldn't even if I could. 

But for those who made up their minds already, they want to also experience (not 
just understand or believe). So this is where we begin.
