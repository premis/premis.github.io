Let us begin with a mantra: " _namo bhagavate bhaiśajyaguru vaidūryaprabharājāya tathāgatāya arhate samyaksambuddhāya tadyathā: oṃ bhaiśajye bhaiśajye bhaiśajya-samudgate svāhā_. " This mantra is known also in the short (chanting) form : "_oṃ bhaiśajye bhaiśajye mahābhaiśajye bhaiśajyarāje samudgate svāhā._"


It is not what we speak, what we talk about and what we say, but rather what we do, how we do it and how we live that reflects the level of being which is attained within us. It does not define it, but reflects it. The choice of words is deliberate, to hopefully dispell those misunderstandings which lead to false illusions of attainment. This is because language is notoriously confusing: to give you an example, the question "why did you do that" means what? To one it could mean "what determined you to do that?", what caused you to act in that way, while for another one it might mean "what did you do that for?", what was the purpose of you doing that? One is past oriented, causal, the other is future oriented, intentional. 

So, such is the power of language, the meaning is resting in the subject, not in the words uttered, but the words do construe the meaning to a sufficient degree to not allow all meanings possible to be communicated by all words just the same. This is similar to the concept of "śūnya" or empty. Words are such. But this is for another article. 

So. It is not our speech that reflects our being, but rather our actions. More than anything then, our speech does not define our level of being. If it does not reflect it, how much more so does it not even define it! What defines it then? This is the true question. 

Action reflects our being, but what defines our being is what determines it and that is the cornerstone of understanding the "self". For it is not the "self" that determines it, but rather the nonself (anattā). 

Buddha rightfully said in the Saṁyutta Nikāya (Dependent Origination): 

*"When this exists, that comes to be; with the arising of this, that arises.*  
*When this does not exist, that does not come to be; *  
*with the cessation of this, that ceases.*  
*That is, with ignorance as condition, volitional formations come to be;*  
*with volitional formations as condition, consciousness….*  
*Such is the origin of this whole mass of suffering." (# 12.41).* 

Indeed, will and volition come as consequences of chains of dependent originations and causative chains of events, or put simply, we are just as determined as anything else, we live a constant illusion of determining ourselves out of sheer ignorance. So what determines our being? It is certainly not ourselves. 

Also in the Udana, it is written: 
*"There is no doer of deeds,*  
*no one who reaps their fruits.*  
*Phenomena alone flow on.*  
*This is the right view."* 

As such, our being can never be trully self-determined, we are determined to be this way or that way, we then just are this way or that way, we act this way or that way. But when we have attained a level of being, we have attained it not by changing our actions, but by allowing all actions to pass without "any" (and I shall repeat) without "any" attempt to interfere (yet careful as this does not advocate passivity). Then it is our consciousness that simply contemplates, fully observes in full awareness the "being", the doing, thus our being is free from it, when we are not attempting to determine it any longer. 

It is then only, that a certain level of being has been attained. And then only the very eventful stream of existence flows in accordance to the dharma, rather than our karma (action). This is also fully revealed by Lord Kṛṣṇa in Bhagavadgītā in verses 27-30 of the Karmayoga chapter, where He informs the reader that the truest self (ātman) does not act, but rather all phenomena (kārya) arise due to nature and causation ( prakṛti and gunas ). 

Now, realize this: Our karma is what our ego (ahaṃkāra) spins by its attempts. It does it by interfering with the flow of events through three mechanisms:   kartṛtva (agency - having the intention to do ), kāraṇatva (instrumentality - being the cause of something ) and  kāryatva (predictability - having an effect as such). These three being present and exerted, the illusion of the self takes roots and reality "as is" cannot be experienced. 

The desirable level of being at which liberation from the karmic entanglements occurs by itself, happens only when the inner examination reveals how these three mechanisms are present and at work, and when they are disolved by a complete abandonment thereof (which is not as easy a thing to do as it is to simply say it). It is then that the emerging flow of being and action is no longer bound, and thus "we" no longer hold reality which cannot be held, "we" no longer hurt. 

Imagine trying to grasp with your hands a barbed wire which is moving fast. It is bound to cut your hands. This is karma, the action of holding that which cannot be held ( the dharma ) and getting hurt in the process. It is not the wire that cuts, it is the action of holding it tight (upādāna) with the desire (tṛṣṇā) to change its course. It is ourselves ( literally our selves - ahaṃkāra) that cuts our hands ( duḥkha ). 

When grasping ceases, nothing dramatic happens. The wire continues to move. The world continues exactly as before. What ends is only the compulsion to hold. And with that, suffering loosens its grip. It is not iresponsability, but the greatest responsability of them all - the ability to respond appropriately, for the first time, to all the happening going around us.
