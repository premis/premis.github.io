In this article we delve into the different ways in which people approach life. 
Make of it what you will. 

> "Wovon man nicht sprechen kann, darüber muss man schweigen" (L. Wittgenstein)

Surely I agree with him entirely. Surely few people ever did, and even fewer 
have any clue as to what he meant. 

For starters, in English, he meant "Of which a human cannot speak, a human must shut up". 
(my translation is a bit violent, but then again I love the German nuance as such). 

The first thing that jumps out at me is what it means to be human, more specifically 
how many layers of meaning are possible in a human mind and yet none is true, 
none is the truth, none is worth speaking of. An entangled human mind gets 
lost in the labyrinthine speech within itself, the speech from the mind, 
unlike the speech from the heart, which at the very least is honest. 

Since we are German today, I should like to draw attention to an interesting concept: **Redlichkeit.**
And it is not interesting because Nietzsche found it to be a pillar for his abysmal 
misapprehension of life, but because two things he managed to see correctly: the eternal 
recurrence and this: Honesty. And honesty is an important thing, it has to do with truth. 
Whatever that may be. 

But the second thing that jumps at me is how very deceiving emotionality can be as well. 
It grasps one by the throat and chokes them in passion. The seams of the mind are
connected to the body through the bridge of emotion. Indeed thought and emotion are
very animal and necessary for survival of the animal vehicle which is the body.

And here it comes (and this is not a thesis): There is no spiritual and there is no material, 
as both are the same thing seen from different perspectives. Imagine a coin, having two sides. Same coin, different views. As they say "two sides of the same coin". There is Reality and that has dimensions. 

There are those who say there is only the material, and deny consciousness 
(and the amount of books on the "hard problem" that provide zero answers is astounding). 
Then there are those who deny the material and in their delusion pronounce: "all is consciousness". 

Let me break it down for you - I am here to destroy, not to serve the empire of Ideas. 
And I am here to tear down, not to enslave others to the narcosis of pleasantness. 
That one I am not here for. To kill the illusions requires absolute and complete dispassion.
Only in such a way can one embrace Life and nourish it with Love. For one who still thinks
love is a feeling - they still cannot see past their very own self and that self-centric 
characteristic is the total opposite of the spiritual goal in absolutely any solid religion 
of this world. This is no news, this is just fact - bland and dry as it may be. Unhappy as
it may be. Unbringer of joy, unprovoking bliss, unstimulating excitement and unrevealing emptiness.

Thus is the Truth. No less. 

So, the first thing: there is no material versus spiritual dichotomy. Except in the mind, 
in words, in concept, and as idea. 

Relativism is a mental fabrication (an intellectual device) for coping with the impossibly complex infinite existence. As such, the Absolute is the sum of all relativities. It is quite easy to notice
that relativism itself being an idea subject to its own whims, is itself relative, 
hence has no meaning. Empty tricks of the deluded mind called rhetoric. Some dare call it
reason, for it imparts to their egos high emotions of superiority and they require those to 
function - not to break down into a pool of suffering. 

One must learn to suffer, then to abolish the suffering and then to love. In this 
process, speech must go ( judgments, criticism, *opinations*, grasping of all the 
mind forms, ideas and constructions ). Then emotion must go ( clinging, joy, hate, envy, 
likes and dislikes, ecstasy, desire, jealousy, craving, anxiety, lust, anger, pride, and dozens 
more). What does it mean? It means peace. One must reach peace. Some reach it by meditation, 
others do it through fasting, others by practicing sports. Some reach peace after experiencing 
unbearable pain (from a great loss or a strong undeniable confrontation with their own mortality) and yet others just get struck by lightning (metaphorically) while taking a stroll in the park or some 
other innocent mundane activity. To some it just happens. To others, they must
work hard for it. 


The language is capable of paradox, it relies on itself ( *there must be a reason for the "one 
hand clapping" koan, isn't there?* ) and so reason which is linguistic must go. Being is 
an experience, not the content thereof. Remember this much, the content of our being, the 
emotion, the thought, the feeling, the sensing, are just that, the content of our being, they
are not our being. Unless we realize our being, some content is unbearable. 

The instruction is simple: paying attention, constantly being aware, being mindful, but this
is not working for most people. Why? Simply because they forget to mind being mindful. And even
if they do, they forget their Redlichkeit, their honesty towards themselves. They lie first to 
themselves, they believe the lies, they keep telling themselves "I am this or I am actually that" 
and by so doing, drift into the movie of their own heads. They are, what can I say, they 
surely believe they are, and then they "become" that. Honesty is brutal - it means I am aware
that I am not this nor that nor anything at all, so why entertain any such figments of narration? 
First and foremost to myself, and then (in an act of courage and unashamed daring) to the world. 

You see, what most people are doing wrong is this: the total opposite of what sets them free. 
It is not by telling ourselves something that we become free, but rather by stopping telling 
ourselves anything at all. We already tell ourselves too many lies that only falsely exist like 
clouds of magic dust in nothingness. Where is Napoleon? For surely "he" was "great". That is our essence, we are like him already, we just don't know it yet. We are already a "have been", the dead. 
Who is there to remember? And so this moment is, but won't for long. Make it worth it say the dead, 
it is so precious and divine that lying about it is the least thing one should do. 


I remember people used to believe that drinking some ridiculous snake oil cured some disease. 
It did not. Yet they believed it, they drank it, and then they rationalized the lack of 
results as lack of trying or worse, lack of faith. This mental dishonesty keeps trailing 
into nowadays, except it has evolved into "spiritual bypassing". 
And there will follow an entire article on that since
it's fundamentally serious for any seeker to be aware of its many perils and deceitful lies.

Deceit - dishonesty - comes in many shapes, not just speech.
How does one know if a belief or even a perception, an understanding, an emotion is honest or not? Surely they are all valid. All that is being experienced is valid - but is it honest? 
An optical illusion is valid, but it's not honest. Similarly with our illusion of self, 
it's damned valid yet so dishonest. 

So. What did Ludwig mean by refraining from speaking?

Certain experiences cannot be communicated, understood or rationalized. They cannot
be expressed in language, nor in words, and are so subjective that nobody else can do anything
with them except the subject in whom they originate. As such, we'd better leave the axioms of reason
where they belong - in silence, in experience, in consciousness alone. 

And this (which came to him after laborious and brilliant intellectual reflections - this self-annihilation of the intellect breaking through to intuitive insight) is because all attempts to "make up" explanatory theory, reasons and sentences about them are inherently dishonest towards them, 
a fakery. A forgery. A lie. So here goes a naturally emerging moral, a healthy precept: "shut up!" 

If one cannot speak of things, one cannot speak of that which is not honest. This is the 
first rule. Radical honesty with yourself from this moment onward. It will do wonders. It will
shift your world. It will utterly destroy it.
